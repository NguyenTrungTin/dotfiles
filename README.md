# My macOS and Linux dotfiles

> Dotfiles are awesome!

## Getting Started

There are my dotfiles that I use on my macOS and Linux machine. The main focus are about VIM and Tmux and ZSH. This repository also contain `.icons`, `.themes` and `.fonts` that I used on my Ubuntu desktop. 

Please consider that all settings in there are just for my persional value. You can clone this repository and customize some settings before installing.

The `install.sh` scripts will automatically backup your current dotfiles into the `dotfiles-backup` directory. So you can revert if you want.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the `git`, `VIM`, `Tmux`, `wget/curl` on your machine first. Of course! 

It's not mandatory but it's better if you install all util tools on your machine. These are awesome tools and help you become much more productivity! 

- [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/) - a tool like grep, optimized for programmers
- [rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - ripgrep - recursively searches directories for a regex pattern
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - A command-line fuzzy finder

### Installing

To install dotfiles, you can you the install script using cURL:

```sh
curl -o- | bash
```

Or Wget:

```sh
wget -qO- | bash
```
